h1. Akka chat server

This is just an experimental project which aims at creating an Akka/WebSocket based
chat server. I am just trying to learn some Scala/Akka and new HTML stuff. There
is a lot to be desired in this project. Feel free to comment.

h2. Running the server

So far there is no packaging mechanism included. In theory you only have to setup sbt as described at http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/wiki/Setup and then execute "sbt run" in the project root. You can visit the UI (well the "textarea") at localhost:9998/app/.
