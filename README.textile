h1. Akka chat server

This is just an experimental project which aims at creating an Akka/WebSocket based
chat server. I am just trying to learn some Scala/Akka and new HTML stuff. There
is a lot to be desired in this project. Feel free to comment.

h2. Building & Running the server

So far there is no packaging mechanism included. 
The build is realised via Gradle (http://www.gradle.org/).
Just install Gradle and type:

	gradle akkaRun
	
inside the project root. You can visit the UI (well the "textarea") at 
http://localhost:9998/app/.
